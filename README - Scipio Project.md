## Project Course 1

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. 


## Loading the data

Every R scripts assume that you have loaded the dataset into your pc.
If you want to reproduce the syntax on your pc, please set the right work directory.


## Inspecting my repo


You will find:

* Four separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot. The code file includes code for reading
the data, assuming it has stored on your pc as .txt file on your work directory.

* Four plot files: `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, `plot4.png`, `plot4.png`.

* An extra R code file which performs data downloading, storage, and estimates data size.
